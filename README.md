# 🚀 C++ + DSA + Interview Preparation

**A structured, end-to-end repository designed to help you learn C++, master Data Structures & Algorithms, and perform with confidence in technical interviews.**

This repository is built to guide you from **strong C++ fundamentals** to **interview-ready problem solving**, following preparation patterns consistently used by candidates who succeed in product-based company interviews.

The focus goes beyond simply getting accepted solutions. It emphasizes **logical thinking**, **clean and optimized code**, and **clear communication of ideas**—the exact qualities interviewers assess at every stage.

## 🎯 Goals & Outcomes

By completing this repository systematically, you will be able to:

* Build a **strong and reliable foundation in C++**
* Master **Data Structures and Algorithms**, from fundamentals to advanced topics
* Solve **frequently asked interview problems** with confidence
* Break down complex problems into clear, logical steps
* Write optimized solutions with proper time and space analysis
* Explain your thought process clearly during interviews
* Prepare effectively for both **technical** and **HR/behavioral** rounds

## 🧠 Learning Approach

The repository follows a **three-pillar interview preparation framework**, ensuring balanced growth across concepts, problem-solving ability, and interview performance.

### 1️⃣ C++ Fundamentals

A strong command of C++ is critical for writing efficient and reliable interview solutions. This section ensures you develop that confidence by focusing on:

* Core language syntax and best practices
* Practical use of **STL containers and algorithms**
* Deep understanding of **pointers, references, and memory management**
* Application of **Object-Oriented Programming principles**:

  * Encapsulation
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
* Consistent analysis of **time and space complexity**

The objective is to help you write **clean, optimized, and interview-grade C++ code** without hesitation.

### 2️⃣ Data Structures & Algorithms

The DSA roadmap is aligned with **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**, one of the most trusted and comprehensive interview preparation guides.

🔗 Reference roadmap:
[https://takeuforward.org/dsa/strivers-a2z-sheet-learn-dsa-a-to-z](https://takeuforward.org/dsa/strivers-a2z-sheet-learn-dsa-a-to-z)

This section emphasizes:

* Understanding **why** a data structure or algorithm is used
* Recognizing common **problem-solving patterns**
* Writing solutions that are both efficient and readable

Covered topics include:

* Arrays and Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees and Binary Search Trees
* Graphs (BFS, DFS, Topological Sort)
* Recursion and Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms and Sliding Window
* Heaps and Tries

Problems are arranged progressively, moving from basic concepts to **interview-level challenges**.

### 3️⃣ Interview-Centric Practice

This section bridges the gap between **learning DSA** and **executing well in interviews**.

Key elements include:

* The **Blind 75 LeetCode problems**, covering the most commonly asked interview questions
* Topic-wise and difficulty-wise categorization
* Well-structured C++ solutions with clear explanations
* Optimized approaches with detailed time and space complexity analysis

LeetCode reference:
🔗 [https://leetcode.com/problemset/](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)

The philosophy here is **depth over volume**—solving fewer problems thoroughly rather than many problems superficially.
