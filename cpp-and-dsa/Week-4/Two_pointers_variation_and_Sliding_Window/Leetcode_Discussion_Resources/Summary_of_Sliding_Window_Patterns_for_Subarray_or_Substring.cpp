// Summary of Sliding Window Patterns for Subarray/Substring
/*
    The sliding window technique is an 
    algorithmic optimization method used for 
    solving problems that involve contiguous 
    subarrays or substrings.
    This technique invloves maintaing a "Window" 
    (a range of elements) that slides across the data structure, 
    typically an array or a string. Instead of 
    recalculating a value for a value for every possible subarray
    from stractch, the sliding window reuses past computations by
    increamentally updating the results as the window moves.
