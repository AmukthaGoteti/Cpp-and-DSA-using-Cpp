/* 
    Problem:
        You are given a code that prints three integers a, b, and c. 
        You need to comment on the line of code that prints the integer b such that this line does not compile.
    Example :
        Input: a = 5, b = 6, c = 15
        Output: 5 15
        Explanation: Only the value of a and c is printed as the line of code that prints b is commented.
