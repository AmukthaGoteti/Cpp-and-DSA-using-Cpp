        its size inside [] square brackets
        (better known as array subscript operator).
        The syntax to declare an array is:
        data_type array_name [size]
        This statement will create an array with name array_name 
        that can store size elements of given data_type. 
        Once the array is declared, its size cannot be changed.

    // the size of the array.
